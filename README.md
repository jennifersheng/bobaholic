# Jennifer Sheng (jss8ny) iOS Final Project App
project-bobaholic created by GitHub Classroom

Bobaholic is the food tracking app for all things bubble tea related. For all boba lovers, Bobaholic is a way to keep track of all the bubble tea one has consumed, getting insights on all your tea consumption stats, keeping track of drink preferences, and even finding new spots for that bubble tea fix near you.

# Major Features/Screens:
The biggest feature/set of screens for the app is centered around the data of the drinks themselves. Labeled with the “Home” tab on the bottom bar, a user is able to add different bubble tea shops they want to keep track of as the first layer of tracking drinks as a whole. Once a shop has been created, the user is able to add drinks from that shop to a running list. Every drink information page includes the information the user has included for preferences of that drink as well as an order button.

The order button brings us to the next major feature of the app. Under the “Order” section of the tab bar, a user is able to see all the various drinks they have tracked through the aforementioned “Order” button. While this page is mainly meant to get a general overview of what were the previous drinks one has ordered, a user is able to click on each table entry, which will redirect them to a page with more information about the order and will let them alter the date of the order if a user would like.
Besides tracking the drinks themselves, the user is also able to get more insight about the orders they have made within a given year. On the “Stats” section of the tab bar, a user is able to get in real time how many drinks they have consumed and how much money they have spent in a single year. With this screen, the user is also able to change the year in order to see insights of drink stats from other years besides the current one as well.

The other two sections of the tab bar include “Map” and “Search” – these are both fairly self-explanatory. The “Map” screen allows a user to see their own location and search for locations near them as any map would. The purpose of this page is to allow the user to see which bubble tea places are near them without having to move to another app. Similarly with the “Search” bar, it is preset to be a Google page with search “boba near me” already pre-populated. This allows the user to not only quickly discover potentially new bubble tea shops near them but also allows the user to interact with Google in general with the intention of allowing them to quickly look up menus from stores they like as well.
